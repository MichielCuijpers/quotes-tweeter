== Quotes Tweeter

Quotes Tweeter does just that. It tweets quotes.

== Configuration

An example configuration YAML file:

    general:
      file: nietzsche.txt
      suffix: Friedrich Nietzsche
      random_seed: 1844
    twitter:
      consumer_key: [your_consumer_key]
      consumer_secret: [your_consumer_secret]
      oauth_token: [oauth_token]
      oauth_token_secret: [oauth_token_secret]

The general section of this configuration defines from which file to read
the quotes, the suffix (author) of the quotes and optionally a random seed,
which make the randomization of the tweeter predictable.

The twitter section of the configuration file contains the twitter keys and
secrets. You can obtain these at https://dev.twitter.com/apps.

== Neil Young

This small library was created by Roel van Dijk for @neilyounglyrics

A file with example quotes has been included in the data folder.
